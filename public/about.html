    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there! I'm a 44-year-old former social worker hailing from the picturesque Netherlands. While my journey started
        in the realm of social work, I've embarked on an exciting new adventure in the world of coding.</p>

    <p>My trusty companions on this coding journey are <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
        <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong>. You'll often find me immersed in courses
        from platforms like <em>Udemy</em>, <em>EdX</em>, and <em>FreeCodeCamp</em>, eagerly soaking up knowledge to expand
        my coding horizons. My biggest ally in this pursuit? None other than the ever-reliable <em>Google</em>, guiding
        me through the intricacies of programming and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>From aiding individuals in need to crafting lines of code, my transition has been nothing short of remarkable. I'm on
        a quest to combine my passion for helping people with the limitless possibilities of coding, and who knows where
        this path will lead me next?</p>

    <p>Join me on this thrilling journey, and together, we'll unravel the world of technology one code at a time!</p>
